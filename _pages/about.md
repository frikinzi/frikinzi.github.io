I am Angela Jiang, a computational biology and bioinformatics Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland and the National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health. I am co-advised by [Dr. Brantley Hall](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zgcl-SoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) and [Dr. Xiaofang Jiang](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/jianglab/index.html). Broadly, I am interested in microbiomes, evolution and developing bioinformatic tools to analyze complex biological data. While I always work on a computer, I frequently collaborate with experimental biologists to verify my findings and aid in the design of experiments.

I received my B.A. in biological sciences from Smith College in 2023. There, I studied microbial eukaryotes under [Dr. Laura Katz](https://www.science.smith.edu/katz-lab/). My senior thesis was *Characterizing Lineage-Specific Genes in Testate Lobose Amoebae*.

Outside of research, my hobbies include keeping invertebrate and aquatic pets, video games, piano, and developing mods for games. You can check out my Minecraft bird mod [here](https://github.com/frikinzi/frikinzis_fauna).
