I am Angela Jiang, a computational biology and bioinformatics Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland. I am co-advised by [Dr. Brantley Hall](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zgcl-SoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) and [Dr. Xiaofang Jiang](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/jianglab/index.html). Broadly, I am interested in microbiomes, evolution and developing bioinformatic tools to analyze complex biological data. While I always work on a computer, I frequently collaborate with experimental biologists to verify my findings and aid in the design of experiments.

Outside of research, I love hiking, video games, and developing mods for games! You can check out my Minecraft bird mod [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/creatures).
