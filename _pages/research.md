An overarching theme of my research is to characterize key health-related functions of the gut microbiome. I do this through examining gut microbial enzymes using comparative genomics and by developing computational tools. 

## Gut microbial enzymes
Gut microbes directly influence human health and disease by metabolizing diverse dietary and other host-derived compounds. Gut microbial enzymes are implicated in these functions by catalyzing key metabolic reactions, but most of them are yet to be identified. I use comparative genomics to identify gut microbial enzymes and characterize their evolutionary history, in addition to their taxonomic distribution. I collaborate with my wet lab colleagues to experimentally verify my predictions.

## Computational genomics
I am interested in developing user friendly computational tools and pipelines to analze and interpret complex biological genomics data, particularly in relation to enzymes. I developed EzSEA (Enzyme Sequence Evolution Analysis), a web tool to identify evolutionarily important mutations in an enzyme using ancestral state reconstruction. You can check it out [here](https://jianglabnlm.com/ezsea/).
