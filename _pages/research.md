These are some of my current research topics. 

## Gut microbial enzymes
Gut microbes directly influence human health and disease, contributing to key functions such as steroid metabolism, bile metabolism, and nutrient production. Gut microbial enzymes are implicated in these functions, but most of them are yet to be identified. I use comparative genomics to identify gut microbial enzymes and characterize their evolutionary history, in addition to taxonomic distribution. I collaborate with my wet lab colleagues to experimentally verify my predictions.

## Computational genomics
I am interested in developing computational tools to analze and interpret complex biological genomics data, particularly in relation to enzymes. I am currently developing a web tool named EzSEA (Enzyme Sequence Evolution Analysis) to identify evolutionarily important mutations in an enzyme's evolutionary history using ancestral state reconstruction.
