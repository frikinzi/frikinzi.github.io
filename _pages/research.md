An overarching theme of my research is to characterize key health-related functions of the gut microbiome. I do this through examining gut microbial enzymes using comparative genomics and by developing computational tools. 

## Gut microbial enzymes
Gut microbes directly influence human health and disease, contributing to key functions such as steroid metabolism, bile metabolism, and nutrient production. Gut microbial enzymes are implicated in these functions by catalyzing key metabolic reactions, but most of them are yet to be identified. I use comparative genomics to identify gut microbial enzymes and characterize their evolutionary history, in addition to their taxonomic distribution. I collaborate with my wet lab colleagues to experimentally verify my predictions.

As an example, I have been involved in the characterization of a gut microbial progesterone reductase (check out our preprint [here](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.04.616736)), and a convergently evolved 5-KDG aldolase GudL in diverse gut bacteria (in revision).

## Computational genomics
I am interested in developing user friendly computational tools and pipelines to analze and interpret complex biological genomics data, particularly in relation to enzymes. I am currently developing a web tool named EzSEA (Enzyme Sequence Evolution Analysis) to identify evolutionarily important mutations in an enzyme's evolutionary history using ancestral state reconstruction.
