I am strongly passionate about science communication, both for a general audience and a scientific audience. I also program mods for games that are hopefully both fun and educational.

## Frikinzi's Fauna

I programmed a Minecraft avian wildlife mod that has been downloaded over 200k times. It adds a variety of realistic bird species and has an interface to learn more about each species. Check out the [GitHub](https://github.com/frikinzi/frikinzis_fauna) if you're interested! (note: the mod has been moved from Curseforge to Modrinth as of October 2024)

There is also a [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/xArJJrAkBg) if you want to follow the mod's updates. 

## Maryland Day
Maryland Day is a annual science outreach event on the University of Maryland campus, where thousands of families participate each year by visiting booths. 

I volunteer at the ecology booth for Maryland Day, and am a member of the committee involved in planning and organizing the booth. I have also volunteered for the gut microbiome booth on Maryland Day.

We aim to raise awareness about the local Maryland wildlife to families, including identifying both invasive and native species.
